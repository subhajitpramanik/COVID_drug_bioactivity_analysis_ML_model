# COVID_drug_bioactivity_analysis_ML_model
Bioactivity analysis machine learning model for potential COVID drug molecules
For this project, we were asked to use and experiment with the drug dataset available at Chembl site, and to explore how to use different machine learning algorithm in a project and find pattern in data.
We were expected gain insights and experience in data cleaning and processing using common data-mining and machine learning library.
We were expected to submit a report about the dataset and different algorithms that were used.
During the project the use of neural network or deep learning techniques were restricted.
This is the report on the data and the techniques used in the project with interpretations.
Use Google Colab to run the file. 
Program collects data directly from Chembl Database at the runtime.

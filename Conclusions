•	The PaDel fingerprint calculations were faster and better for predicting the bioactivity values as compared to Mordred descriptors.
•	After running and observing different models to fit the data the decision tree regressor was better in most of the iterations for Mordred data.
•	After running and observing different models to fit the data the voting regressor was better in most of the iterations for PaDEL data.
•	The max r2 achieved for Mordred data was: 0.395
•	The max r2 achieved for PaDEL data was: 0.642
